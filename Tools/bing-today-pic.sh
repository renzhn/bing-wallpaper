# This script downloads and links Bing's pictures to a fixed link.
#
# This script does three functions:
#   1. Execute bing-wallpaper script to download today's random picture.
#   2. Link it to $PICTURE_DIR/today.jpg
#
# Usage examples: (1) If the desktop background is set to $PICTURE_DIR/today.jpg
# this script will ensure it is always today's bing picture. (2) A Gnome
# slideshow can be setup to rotate between today.jpg and random.jpg. Look at the
# tools under gnome-bing-slideshow/
